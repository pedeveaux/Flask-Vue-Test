## Flask Vue Test Environment
This directory is a test environment for figuring our how to build a Flask application with Vue.js as the front end. 

#### Dependencies
This uses Python version 3.7.3, 64 bit. For other dependencies please see the requirements.txt. I use flake8 and black for linting and code formatting. These libraries are not required for the core functionality of the project.
